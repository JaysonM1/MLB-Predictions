# MLB-Predictions

7/14
Wanted to make a machine learning program that could predict MLB games to the best of its ability


FORMULA file
At first I made my own formula that pulled data from current 2021 season. Each match up gave each team a rating and the team with the higher
rating should win the game. This had an accuracy of about 62-65%. The formula took into account starting pitchers ERA, WHIP, and K/9, the Teams
BA, OBP, and SLG, as well as the teams ERA, WHIP, and K/9 to account to the bullpen and relievers. 

Soon I made the neural network that pulled data similar to the formula file and it had similar results. I suspect I need more game data to increase it as well as more features.
